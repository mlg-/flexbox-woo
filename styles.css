flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
  - governed by the directionality of the text (writing-mode: vertical-rl for ex)
  - determines the main start and main ends of the container

flex-wrap: wrap | no-wrap | reverse;
  - determines whether it is multi-line or single line
  - reverse swaps the cross start and cross end points

flex-flow (shorthand for <flex-direction> <flex-wrap>)

justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around
  - aligns items along the main axis

align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch
  -aligns items along the cross axis

order
  - what it says on the tin, neg & pos ints
  - default is 0
  - great bc it only changes in the styling and not semantically, which helps screen readers etc

align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch
  - override alignment for indiv children
